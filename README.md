# SOR4-Auto-Splitter
Streets of Rage 4 Auto Splitter for LiveSplit

## Known issues/quirks
* Getting a game over doesn't restart the timer.
* Getting a game over in Boss Rush while having the "Boss Defeated" splits activated will trigger a split once the level restarts.
* The timer rarely auto starts right after going back to main menu.
* A wrong split prevention when pausing the game may cause to undo real splits when pausing the game at the right moment (very precise), only affects splits in the middle of levels (Estel and Boss Rush splits).
