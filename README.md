# SOR4-Auto-Splitter
Streets of Rage 4 Auto Splitter for LiveSplit

## Known issues/quirks
* Getting a game over doesn't restart the timer.
* A wrong split prevention when pausing the game may cause to undo splits when pausing the game at the right moment (very, very precise). This can only affect splits in the middle of levels (Estel and Boss Rush splits).
